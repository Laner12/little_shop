# Little Shop

Little Shop is a Turing School of Software and Design Module 2 final group project.

One Fan's Treasure is an exploration into e-commerce with Rails. CRUD, authorization, and authentication are all fully utilized to allow a user to create an account, purchase items, and receive confirmation. An administrator has additional privileges (i.e., the ability to edit their account).
